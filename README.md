# freeboard-percentage-indicator

A way to display a percentage using a bar. 

It will animate on value changes. 
It accepts integers as the values. 

Install - same as any other plugin, include the js file so freeboard can load it, 
eg: 

   head.js("/js/freeboard_plugins.min.js",
                         '/plugins/percentbar/percentbar.js',
                         ... 

It should then appear in the dropdown menu of available widget types

See example.png to see what it looks like, imagine the lovely animations (using css transitions)
